    Group 15: Seokho Han(seokhoh@mun.ca), Yee Teing Lo(ytlo@mun.ca)
## How to run
    1. open <index.html> - use Chrome 
    2. adjust [# of polygon sides, Tessellation, (Filled or Lines), Rotation]

## Tasks achieved 
- [x] • Showing two triangles, one simple and the other tessellated, both in line/wireframe drawing style (see below) (10%)
- [x] • Showing two tessellated and twisted triangles, both in filled-color form (10%)
- [x] • Show four other polygons, starting from a square up to an octagon (skipping heptagon: square, pentagon, hexagon, octagon), in line form (20%)
- [x] • Show the same as in the previous item, but as tessellated polygons (in line/wireframe drawing style), each polygon being split into a smaller set of triangles (using 5 recursive subdivisions) (20%)
- [x] • Show the same as the item above, but as filled and twisted polygons, starting from a triangle on the left to
an octagon (skipping heptagon: triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, octagon), in filled-color form (20%)
- [ ] • Create a flat (2D) shape consisting of at least 10 triangles that is obtained by triangulation of the original
shape and which is displayed either flat shaded or wireframe and which can be twisted by the vertex shader like the previous shapes. For example, a letter ‘P’ made of triangles. (10%)
- [x] • Provide an interface to select among the different combinations (for example, insert a menu item to select
the shape to be drawn, or another menu to select the rendering mode (filled vs. wireframe), or have buttons in the html page to select among the options above. (10%)
- [x] • Extra/Bonus Marks: Show the tessellated polygons with different colors per vertex, using flat or smooth
shading (10%)
